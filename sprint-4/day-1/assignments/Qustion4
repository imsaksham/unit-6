Q4/- Write a small note on Servlet and JSP.
Servlet:-

Servlet technology is used to create a web application. A servlet is a Java class that is used to 
extend the capabilities of servers that host applications accessed by means of a request-response model.
Servlets are mainly used to extend the applications hosted by web services. 

JSP-
 JSP is used to create web applications just like Servlet technology. A JSP is a text document that contains two types of text: static data and dynamic data. The static data can be expressed in any text-based format (like HTML, XML, SVG, and WML), and the dynamic content can be expressed by JSP elements.
