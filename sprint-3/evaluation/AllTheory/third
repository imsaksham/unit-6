QUESTION 2: EXPLANE LIFE THE CYCLE OF THE SPRING BEAN;
           For simple java classes constructor and finalize() methods is the  life cycle methods that
           is called by JVM automatically.
           In spring spring container controls the spring bean life-cycle.;
           there is initalization and destroy methods.;
           There are 5 stages of spring bean class in life cycle;
           1)not exist;
           2)Instansiate;
           3)intialized;
           4)service;
           5)Destroy;
           ***************************************************
           1)At first there s no spring bean object exist.if bean object is singleton scope bean will load by container
           at a time of loading xml file.
           else if it is prototype then load by conataiiner at a time of pulling object
           **********************************************
           2)After this Container load the bean class into the memory and creates the bean class object
           also uses some property and value tags to insert data in bean fields.Also all the dependencies
           is also resolved at a time of instialisation.
           **************************************
           3) In any bean class if there is init method is configured container will call that method
           ***********************************
           4)In Service phase Container provides bean object ref to client,and client and call the service mthod on that
           bean object.
           ***************************************************
           5)Same as init method we have to configure destroy method and call that method by bean object
           to destroy bean object
