 IOC:-

Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) Container is the core of Spring Framework. It creates the objects,
configures and assembles their dependencies, manages their entire life cycle. The Container uses Dependency Injection(DI)
 to manage the components that make up the application. It gets the information about the objects from a configuration
  file(XML) or Java Code or Java Annotations and Java POJO class. These objects are called Beans. Since the Controlling of
  Java objects and their lifecycle is not done by the developers, hence the name Inversion Of Control. The followings are
  some of the main features of Spring IoC,

Creating Object for us,
Managing our objects,
Helping our application to be configurable,
Managing dependencies

Dependecy:-

Dependency Injection is the main functionality provided by Spring IOC(Inversion of Control).
The Spring-Core module is responsible for injecting dependencies through either Constructor or Setter methods.
The design principle of Inversion of Control emphasizes keeping the Java classes independent of each other and the
container frees them from object creation and maintenance. These classes, managed by Spring, must adhere to the standard
definition of Java-Bean. Dependency Injection in Spring also ensures loose coupling between the classes. There are two
types of Spring Dependency Injection.

A. Setter Dependency Injection (SDI)

Setter Injection is the simpler of the two  Dependency Injection methods. In this, the Dependency Injection will be injected with the help of
setter and/or getter methods. Now to set the Dependency Injection as Setter Injection in the bean, it is done through the
 bean-configuration file For this, the property to be set with the Setter Injection is declared under the <property> tag
 in the bean-config file.

B. Constructor Dependency Injection (CDI)

In Constructor Injection, the Dependency Injection will be injected with the help of constructors. Now to set the Dependency
Injection as Constructor Dependency Injection in bean, it is done through the bean-configuration file. For this, the property
 to be set with the CDI is declared under the <constructor-arg> tag in the bean-config file.

Let us finally come up with cut-throat differences between them depicted via the table given below to get a better
understanding as there persists always a dilemma if not understood to great depth.
